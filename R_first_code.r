# This is my first code in github! Yayy

# Here are the input data

# Costanza data on streams
water <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)

# Marta data on fishes genomes
fishes <- c(10, 50, 60, 100, 200)

# plot diversity of fishes (y) versus the amount of water (x)
plot(water, fishes)

# the data we developed can be stored in a table
# a table in R is called data frame

streams <- data.frame(water, fishes)
